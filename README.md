In the context of online advertisingm An impression is when an ad is fetched from its source, and is countable. Whether the ad is clicked is not taken into account. Each time an ad is fetched, it is counted as one impression. 

In Summary, SushiBelt can measure the impression according to the objective visible ratio for each UIView.

- Green Area means a measurable range.
- Red line means a calculated visible ratio from SushiBelt.
- Blue line means a objective visible ratio for impression.

Also, SushiBelt calculates visible ratio as the scroll direction changes.
